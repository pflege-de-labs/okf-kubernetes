# Handling retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure policy

**Feature state:** Kubernetes v1.31 [stable] (feature gate `JobPodFailurePolicy`, enabled by default)

This document shows you how to use the
[Pod failure policy](/concepts/workloads/controllers/job.md#pod-failure-policy),
in combination with the default
[Pod backoff failure policy](/concepts/workloads/controllers/job.md#pod-backoff-failure-policy),
to improve the control over the handling of container- or Pod-level failure
within a [Job](/reference/glossary/job.md).

The definition of Pod failure policy may help you to:
* better utilize the computational resources by avoiding unnecessary Pod retries.
* avoid Job failures due to Pod disruptions (such [preemption](/reference/glossary/preemption.md),
[API-initiated eviction](/reference/glossary/api-eviction.md)
or [taint](/reference/glossary/taint.md)-based eviction).

## Before you begin

You should already be familiar with the basic use of [Job](/concepts/workloads/controllers/job.md).

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a
cluster, you can create one by using
[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tutorials/multi_node/)
or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

* [iximiuz Labs](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds?category=kubernetes&filter=all)
* [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/kubernetes)
* [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/public-playgrounds) Your Kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.25. To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

## Usage scenarios

Consider the following usage scenarios for Jobs that define a Pod failure policy :
- [Avoiding unnecessary Pod retries](#pod-failure-policy-failjob)
- [Ignoring Pod disruptions](#pod-failure-policy-ignore)
- [Avoiding unnecessary Pod retries based on custom Pod Conditions](#pod-failure-policy-config-issue)
- [Avoiding unnecessary Pod retries per index](#backoff-limit-per-index-failindex)

### Using Pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary Pod retries {#pod-failure-policy-failjob}

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
avoid unnecessary Pod restarts when a Pod failure indicates a non-retriable
software bug.

1. Examine the following manifest:

   [`/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/2674d5095a50d781d2f884c83973921f48c5cf28/content/en/examples//controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-failjob
spec:
  completions: 8
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: docker.io/library/bash:5
        command: ["bash"]
        args:
        - -c
        - echo "Hello world! I'm going to exit with 42 to simulate a software bug." && sleep 30 && exit 42
  backoffLimit: 6
  podFailurePolicy:
    rules:
    - action: FailJob
      onExitCodes:
        containerName: main
        operator: In
        values: [42]
```

1. Apply the manifest:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml
   ```

1. After around 30 seconds the entire Job should be terminated. Inspect the status of the Job by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-failjob -o yaml
   ```

   In the Job status, the following conditions display:
   - `FailureTarget` condition: has a `reason` field set to `PodFailurePolicy` and
     a `message` field with more information about the termination, like
     `Container main for pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob-8ckj8 failed with exit code 42 matching FailJob rule at index 0`.
     The Job controller adds this condition as soon as the Job is considered a failure.
     For details, see [Termination of Job Pods](/concepts/workloads/controllers/job.md#termination-of-job-pods).
   - `Failed` condition: same `reason` and `message` as the `FailureTarget`
     condition. The Job controller adds this condition after all of the Job's Pods
     are terminated.

   For comparison, if the Pod failure policy were disabled, the Job would
   retry until reaching the `backoffLimit` (6 failures). Because retries
   use exponential backoff and, with `parallelism: 2`, failures occur in
   pairs, the delay between attempts increases with each retry. As a result,
   this example would take at least 9 minutes before the Job fails.

#### Clean up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

### Using Pod failure policy to ignore Pod disruptions {#pod-failure-policy-ignore}

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
ignore Pod disruptions from incrementing the Pod retry counter towards the
`.spec.backoffLimit` limit.

**Caution:**
Timing is important for this example, so you may want to read the steps before
execution. In order to trigger a Pod disruption it is important to drain the
node while the Pod is running on it (within 90s since the Pod is scheduled).

1. Examine the following manifest:

   [`/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/2674d5095a50d781d2f884c83973921f48c5cf28/content/en/examples//controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-ignore
spec:
  completions: 4
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: docker.io/library/bash:5
        command: ["bash"]
        args:
        - -c
        - echo "Hello world! I'm going to exit with 0 (success)." && sleep 90 && exit 0
  backoffLimit: 0
  podFailurePolicy:
    rules:
    - action: Ignore
      onPodConditions:
      - type: DisruptionTarget
```

1. Apply the manifest:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore.yaml
   ```

1. Run this command to check the `nodeName` the Pod is scheduled to:

   ```sh
   nodeName=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-ignore -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.nodeName}')
   ```

1. Drain the node to evict the Pod before it completes (within 90s):

   ```sh
   kubectl drain nodes/$nodeName --ignore-daemonsets --grace-period=0
   ```

1. Inspect the `.status.failed` to check the counter for the Job is not incremented:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-ignore -o yaml
   ```

1. Uncordon the node:

   ```sh
   kubectl uncordon nodes/$nodeName
   ```

The Job resumes and succeeds.

For comparison, if the Pod failure policy was disabled the Pod disruption would
result in terminating the entire Job (as the `.spec.backoffLimit` is set to 0).

#### Cleaning up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

### Using Pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary Pod retries based on custom Pod Conditions {#pod-failure-policy-config-issue}

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
avoid unnecessary Pod restarts based on custom Pod Conditions.

**Note:**
The example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of
deleted pods, in the `Pending` phase, to a terminal phase
(see: [Pod Phase](/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle.md#pod-phase)).

1. Examine the following manifest:

   [`/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/2674d5095a50d781d2f884c83973921f48c5cf28/content/en/examples//controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
spec:
  completions: 8
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: "non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example"
  backoffLimit: 6
  podFailurePolicy:
    rules:
    - action: FailJob
      onPodConditions:
      - type: ConfigIssue
```

1. Apply the manifest:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml
   ```

   Note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.

1. Inspect the status of the job's Pods by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml
   ```

   You will see output similar to this:
   ```yaml
   containerStatuses:
   - image: non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example
      ...
      state:
      waiting:
         message: Back-off pulling image "non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example"
         reason: ImagePullBackOff
         ...
   phase: Pending
   ```

   Note that the pod remains in the `Pending` phase as it fails to pull the
   misconfigured image. This, in principle, could be a transient issue and the
   image could get pulled. However, in this case, the image does not exist so
   we indicate this fact by a custom condition.

1. Add the custom condition. First prepare the patch by running:

   ```sh
   cat <<EOF > patch.yaml
   status:
     conditions:
     - type: ConfigIssue
       status: "True"
       reason: "NonExistingImage"
       lastTransitionTime: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
   EOF
   ```
   Second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:
   ```
   podName=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
   ```

   Then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

   ```sh
   kubectl patch pod $podName --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml
   ```

   If applied successfully, you will get a notification like this:

   ```sh
   pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched
   ```

1. Delete the pod to transition it to `Failed` phase, by running the command:

   ```sh
   kubectl delete pods/$podName
   ```

1. Inspect the status of the Job by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml
   ```

   In the Job status, see a job `Failed` condition with the field `reason`
   equal `PodFailurePolicy`. Additionally, the `message` field contains a
   more detailed information about the Job termination, such as:
   `Pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp has condition ConfigIssue matching FailJob rule at index 0`.

**Note:**
In a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a
user-provided controller.

#### Cleaning up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

### Using Pod Failure Policy to avoid unnecessary Pod retries per index {#backoff-limit-per-index-failindex}

To avoid unnecessary Pod restarts per index, you can use the _Pod failure policy_ and
_backoff limit per index_ features. This section of the page shows how to use these features
together.

1. Examine the following manifest:

   [`/controllers/job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/2674d5095a50d781d2f884c83973921f48c5cf28/content/en/examples//controllers/job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex
spec:
  completions: 4
  parallelism: 2
  completionMode: Indexed
  backoffLimitPerIndex: 1
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: docker.io/library/python:3
        command:
          # The script:
          # - fails the Pod with index 0 with exit code 1, which results in one retry;
          # - fails the Pod with index 1 with exit code 42 which results
          #   in failing the index without retry.
          # - succeeds Pods with any other index.
          - python3
          - -c
          - |
            import os, sys
            index = int(os.environ.get("JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX"))
            if index == 0:
              sys.exit(1)
            elif index == 1:
              sys.exit(42)
            else:
              sys.exit(0)
  backoffLimit: 6
  podFailurePolicy:
    rules:
    - action: FailIndex
      onExitCodes:
        containerName: main
        operator: In
        values: [42]
```

1. Apply the manifest:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex.yaml
   ```

1. After around 15 seconds, inspect the status of the Pods for the Job. You can do that by running:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex -o yaml
   ```

   You will see output similar to this:

   ```none
   NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
   job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex-0-4g4cm   0/1     Error       0          4s
   job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex-0-fkdzq   0/1     Error       0          15s
   job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex-1-2bgdj   0/1     Error       0          15s
   job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex-2-vs6lt   0/1     Completed   0          11s
   job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex-3-s7s47   0/1     Completed   0          6s
   ```

   Note that the output shows the following:

   * Two Pods have index 0, because of the backoff limit allowed for one retry
   of the index.
   * Only one Pod has index 1, because the exit code of the failed Pod matched
   the Pod failure policy with the `FailIndex` action.

1. Inspect the status of the Job by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex -o yaml
   ```

   In the Job status, see that the `failedIndexes` field shows "0,1", because
   both indexes failed. Because the index 1 was not retried the number of failed
   Pods, indicated by the status field "failed" equals 3.

#### Cleaning up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-backoff-limit-per-index-failindex
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

## Alternatives

You could rely solely on the
[Pod backoff failure policy](/concepts/workloads/controllers/job.md#pod-backoff-failure-policy),
by specifying the Job's `.spec.backoffLimit` field. However, in many situations
it is problematic to find a balance between setting a low value for `.spec.backoffLimit`
 to avoid unnecessary Pod retries, yet high enough to make sure the Job would
not be terminated by Pod disruptions.
